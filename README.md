Parliament Scraping notebooks for several national assemblies


Projects such as 'Radio Parlamento'/'Radio Bundestag'/'Radio Folketing'/'Ελληνική Ραδιοφωνία' (http://expressao.xyz/radio/index.php)
use the transcripts of national parliaments to create a hotlinkable, referenceable, shareable 'radio' with their sessions.

In these notebooks we exemplify how to scrape the data from the national parliament websites.

DE, DK, EL and BE were chosen to start as they seemed to be the easiest websites from which to pull complete transcripts of each session.
